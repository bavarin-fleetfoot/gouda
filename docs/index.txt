Gouda is a script which takes a bunch of text files, converts them to
html (using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)), and stitches
them together as chapters into a navigable whole. It also generates a
table of contents page. (This site was created with Gouda and uses its
default low-contrast style.)

Gouda aims to help make creating documentation as easy as possible,
and requires pretty much zero configuration.

For more about why Gouda exists, and the benefits of using Gouda, see
the [rationale & benefits](./rationale-and-benefits.html) page.

To see the rest of the Gouda documentation, please follow the "Table
of Contents" link at the top.



Detailed Usage
==============

 1. Create a directory to hold your docs (often called "docs").
 2. Put some
    [Pandoc-Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown)-formatted
    ".txt" files into it (at least an "index.txt" file plus 2 others,
    none named "toc.txt"). These files must contain a simple "title
    block" at the top, as shown in the [example
    below](#simple-template).
 3. Run `gouda.py` in that directory.
 4. Put the docs directory online, if you like.

For example:

~~~~{.bash}
cd my-project
mkdir docs
cd docs
touch index.txt overview.txt tutorial.txt examples.txt  # etc.
# edit files
gouda.py
# upload docs, for example:
rsync -urv --delete /path/to/your-proj/docs you@remote:public_html/your-proj
~~~~

That last rsync command will put the local docs directory into the
remote your-proj directory.



What it Does
============

Gouda will generate cross-linked html files (from the text files), and
also create a table of contents (toc.html (and toc.txt)) file for
you. The resulting html files will reside in the same directory
together with the ".txt" files.

Gouda will also generate a default "styles.css" file, which you can
customize, or use as-is (this site uses it as-is).

Each ".txt" file should represent one "chapter". To rearrange the
order in which the chapters are listed in the ToC, edit the
autogenerated "toc.conf" file and re-run gouda.py.

The index.txt file is special, and it's required. It serves as the
"front page" of your documentation. Also, it's title (in the "[title
block](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-block)")
should be the name of your project â€” it will be shown in the header
of every generated page.

If you subsequently add more files to your docs dir, either likewise
add them to the toc.conf file, or else just delete the toc.conf file
and let it be regenerated the next time you run gouda.py.

<a id="simple-template"/>
As a simple template, start your docs looking like this:

~~~~
% Title Goes Here
% Author Name
% 2011-Oct-31

Some text.

An H1 Heading
=============

Some text.

An H2 Heading
-------------

etc.
~~~~

The title after the '%' is what will appear in the ToC (except for
index.txt, the title of which will be used as the name of your
documentation project).

Example](quick-markdown-example.html).

Once you've got some docs written, just rsync/ftp/scp your docs dir to
the web to publish them.



Install
=======

Prerequisites:

  * Python 2.x
  * [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Instructions for
    installing Pandoc are on its website. For Debian-based GNU/Linux
    distributions, it's: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`

To install Gouda, just save the gouda.py file (see link at top of
page) to somewhere in your $PATH (such as `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)
and make sure it's executable (`chmod +x gouda.py`).
