Gouda is an easy-to-use documentation processing tool.

It's a Python script which takes a bunch of text files, converts
them to html (using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)), and
stitches them together as chapters into a coherent navigable whole. It
also generates a table of contents page.
